This is an app where a user can scan pieces of garbage on their mobile device. Using Machine Learning, it will be able to classify what kind of garbage it is and whether it is recyclable based on its confidence. If it is recyclable, it will provide instructions on how to recycle it, if not, the user will be able to sell it on our marketplace.
